# Mrror

A simple accountability tool keeping you aligned.

## Overview

Mrror is a minimal Next.js web app that helps you stay aligned with your goals through daily reflection. It asks two powerful questions:

All responses are saved locally in your browser with timestamps, creating a personal journal of your journey.
